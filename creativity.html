  <!-- Description Box -->
  <div class="description-box">
    <p>
      For me, creativity can only mean one thing, it expresses feelings. It makes people think outside the box, expand their mind, and explore their ideas. Some people get their best thoughts after some emotional outbreak, when feelings are strong, they become creative and start thinking differently. Creativity is when you combine your emotions with your ideas and make something new, something that can be shared with others. In graphic design, creativity is about turning feelings into visuals that communicate, make people feel, or make them think. It’s not just about making things look nice, it’s about expressing yourself and connecting with others through your work.
      Culture to me is about differences. Everyone is different, just like creativity. We are all humans, but when it comes to creativity and culture, everyone has their own way of doing things, their own ideas, and their own traditions. Culture is a big word for me. I have my own culture, my community has its ways and beliefs. For example, my community celebrates the birth of gods, and we have 23 million gods, each with its own story. These traditions and beliefs shape the way I see the world and the way I create. Culture gives context to creativity, it influences how we think, what inspires us, and how we make our work meaningful.
      Creativity and culture work together. Culture gives ideas and inspiration, while creativity lets you express those ideas in your own way. For me, when I create, I think about my feelings and my culture. I try to combine them to make work that is honest, personal, and expressive. By letting my emotions guide me, and considering my cultural background, I can create designs that are not only creative but also meaningful.
